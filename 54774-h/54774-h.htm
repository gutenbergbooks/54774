<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>There is a Latin saying that “Fortune frustrates, single-handed, the
plans of learned men.” There are moments in the lives of each of us
when we do not seem to be masters of our actions, but are led by blind
chance into paths which bring success or failure in spite of our own
individual efforts. We stand in awe before a power which seems inimical
to us, or rejoice over a series of coincidences that boost us into fame
and fortune.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand, therefore, why men of all ages have had a
restless striving to search out the Unknown and the Unknowable, and
to endeavor to foretell the future and its mysterious dispensations.
In all ages, men have endeavored in various ways to penetrate the
mysteries of the future. They have consulted the stars, the oracles,
deities of their own manufacture, cards of various devices, etc., in an
effort to solve the problems about them.</p>

<p>There is a vein of superstition in every human being, and some of the
world’s greatest geniuses, statesmen, scientists and warriors have not
been ashamed to seek information from prophets and seers, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
tangle of life seemed too difficult for them to unravel thru their own
efforts. The pages of history as well as the Holy Bible are full of
instances where the power of divination was invoked to settle important decisions.</p>

<p>This book has been compiled for the use of intelligent people who
desire to know the various ways in which events have been prophesied
by occultists the world over, and who wish to test their own faculties
and consult the Book of Fate in their own behalf. The various methods
and tables are offered to the reader at their own value, without any
special claim for their accuracy or efficacy. Each inquirer must
determine for himself how far he may trust the oracle that he has
consulted. Some of the material is new and is not to be found in modern
books of this nature. Most of the tables have been gleaned from very
old authorities.</p>

<p>It must be understood that successful consultations depend in a great
measure on the psychic operations in the mind of the inquirer, who
must approach the subject with a desire to know the truth. There is an
intuitive perception in all minds, which can be developed by practice.
The inquirer should not be discouraged by lack of success at the start.
It must be remembered that any attempt to force a favorable divination
by cards or astrology is unfair and makes the whole operation void.</p>

</div>

<h3>Historical Review</h3>

<p>Astrology, the science of the stars and their influence on the lives
and destinies of human beings, is a very old and honorable subject. It
was early developed in Egypt and flourished chiefly in Chaldea, whose
star-gazers and prognosticators were so famous that the name “Chaldee”
came to be used as having the same meaning as Astrologer, not only
in the Bible but among ancient writers. In the East it still has its
followers and is much practiced by the Arabs and Asiatics. Its vogue
in Rome and Greece was great, but it was forbidden by the Emperor
Augustus, only to be revived later. The Moors in Spain held it in great
respect and made it popular among the nations of Europe.</p>

<p>Astrology continued to be popular until the sixteenth century. It was
practiced by the European courts as late as the eighteenth century,
even in England. It was considered a worthy science even by the great
astronomer Kepler, and Lilly, another astronomer, was called before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the House of Commons in the reign of Charles II to give his opinion of
future events.</p>

<p>Astrology teaches us that the heavenly bodies influence not only the
earth but all living creatures on the globe. Every child born is
subject to the planet or star under which it came to life. When a child
is born its mind is still a blank and its character unformed. The stars
find a ready tablet on which to record their marks for good or evil,
and the character, disposition, passions, gifts, talents, etc., which
the child will show in later years are decided on thru the influence of
the heavenly bodies. Thus, the planet Mercury gives wisdom and force
of mind; Venus gives the power of loving; Mars, the desire to work and
fight; etc.</p>

<p>The general method of procedure in discovering the characteristics or
deciding the fate of a man is to draw a horoscope, representing the
position of the stars and planets in the whole heaven or within one
degree of the eastern horizon, at the time of the individual’s birth.
If the horoscope is to decide the success of an undertaking the date of
the same is taken as a starting-point. Significance is given to each
of the heavenly bodies as they appear singly or in conjunction and the
horoscope is interpreted according to these significations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The great physician, Paracelsus, was enthusiastic in his teachings
that the heavenly bodies had a great effect upon the bodies of men,
especially upon their diseases, and many doctors until recent years
consulted the stars in an endeavor to find the proper remedies for the
suffering.</p>

<p>The Bible has many instances which show the esteem in which Astrology
was held. In the very first part we read that God made the stars to
serve as “signs, seasons and days.” We read that the “stars in their
courses fought against Sisera.” This shows how the heavenly bodies were
supposed to influence the deeds of men.</p>

<p>We all know that the tides are caused by the pulling of the moon, and
that this planet would be a dreary waste were it not for the light and
heat it gets from the sun. We have recently discovered that the sun’s
rays also give us health, that they possess a great curative power and
that the ultraviolet rays are of benefit in many diseases. It is but
natural to suppose, therefore, that other planets and even distant
stars influence this earth and its inhabitants. Many of the stars of
which we see but dim specks are many thousands of times bigger than our
sun and may exert a correspondingly great influence.</p>

<p>All celestial bodies probably do have some influence on our minds and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
our bodies. They move in their orbits just as each human being has his
own circle or orbit in which he moves from birth to death. It seems
rational to suppose that every individual is subject to the influence
of some particular planet which was in the ascendant at the time of his
or her birth, and that a knowledge of the planet may help decide the
ultimate career and fortune of the child.</p>

<p>We may go further and claim that the planet of a child may affect the
future of the parents and that there is a mysterious relation between
the parents and their offspring. The orbits of the parents are often
entirely changed by the coming of a child. It is not a rare occurrence
to have the influence of the child completely overpower the lives of
the parents. We all are acquainted with folks who date their good or
bad fortune from the birth of a particular child. People who have been
respected and prosperous seem suddenly hounded by misfortune after the
birth of a son, and end in poverty. On the other hand, many a family
can date its good fortune from the day a son or daughter was born to them.</p>

<p>Dame Fortune is certainly a fickle fairy who dispenses her good and bad
gifts with an erratic hand, and no one can tell what fate may befall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
“Read the answer in the stars,” is the only logical reply to the many
puzzles that come up for solution.</p>

<p>Warnings and danger signals are shown to us by nature more often than
we think. But we are so intent on our troubles or on making money that
we fail to recognize them. Nature has resource to dreams, premonitions,
signs and omens to tell us of our impending fate. We are often agitated
without knowing why, have moods of depression and causeless fears. They
are portents on the part of nature that we are often too ignorant to heed.</p>

<p>A study of Astrology may help us avoid many pitfalls. It must not be
considered from a superstitious point of view, but as a possible fact
in nature that may lead us to better things.</p>

<h3>Astrological Readings</h3>

<p>A system which will tell with exactitude what every person born under
a particular star can accomplish, or what his particular bent or
talent may be, is manifestly impossible. Every individual is subject
to so many outside influences, is attracted or repelled by so many
subtle, mental or psychic influences, that his astrological status is
constantly undergoing some change. Just as every planet is subject to
the force of gravity of every other heavenly body which pulls it out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
its ordained course, so is every human mind swayed and turned from its
original course. Only the expert in astrological lore can reconcile
these various influences and give a correct reading of the future.</p>

<p>The following tables, however, will give the reader a fairly correct
estimate of his character, traits, faults and talents.</p>

<h3>The Astrological Guide to Fortune</h3>

<p>First find the exact date of your birth, express the numbers in
one line. For instance: Let us say you were born April 5, 1876. April
is the fourth month of the year; you must therefore write the date
4.5.1876. Now add these numbers thus&emsp;4 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 31.
Repeat the addition with the resulting number&emsp;3 + 1 = 4. You now
have a sum resulting in a single digit. This digit is your “Key of
Fortune,” which gives you access to your planetary future. Now you must
find your planet by adding the number of your present month to this
Key. If the present month happens to be July, add 7. 4 plus 7 equals
11. Repeating the addition 1 plus 1 equals 2. You must now look for
No. 2 in the “Planetary Chart” on <a href="#planetary">page 9</a>. You
will find that Jupiter is the custodian of your Key. You will find in
the <a href="#primal">table on page 9</a>, that the house of Jupiter is
designated by the letter B. Next consult the <a href="#primal">table of Primal Questions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
on page 9</a> and select one of the 12 questions which you desire answered.</p>

<p>Let us suppose you selected question No. 1, “Does—— love me?
”Consult the <a href="#horoscope">Horoscope Chart on page 8</a> and you
will find that question No. 1 is ruled by Aquarius. You will now turn
to <a href="#table_b">Table B</a>, which was the letter corresponding
to the house of Jupiter and look for Aquarius, which gives the answer
“The person loves others besides you.”</p>

<p>This is but one of the ways in which these astrological tables can be
used. It is always best to consult an expert in this science, in order
to obtain scientific results. Those counting their birthdays according
to the Hebrew or Russian calendars will find the answer equally
correct. Another method of consulting the oracle is to add the letters
in your first name, counting one for A, two for B, etc., and proceeding
as in the case of the dates, until there is one digit.</p>

<p>Names have in all religious systems been considered of great influence
in determining a person’s fate. The ancients were careful in selecting
names for their children, believing that certain names could bring good
or bad luck. Names were often changed in order to coerce Dame Fortune.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Thus Abram had his name changed to Abraham; Jacob had his name changed
to Israel. Among the orthodox Jews it is still customary to change the
name of a very sick or an unlucky person.</p>

<p>Shakespeare may well ask, “What’s in a name?” According to Astrology,
the name signifies very much.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Determine the Lucky and Unlucky Days of Any Month.</span></h3>

<p class="center space-below1">(<i>This method is taken from an ancient treatise on Astrology.</i>)</p>

<p>Ascertain from any almanac the day on which a full moon occurs, and
count the number of days from that to the end of the month: you then
multiply the number of days in the month by the number ascertained as
above, and the total will give you the lucky days (subject to a further
test hereafter explained). If the total happens to be, say, 516, the
lucky days of that month would be the 5th and 16th, and if it should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
399—as neither of these figures can be paired—the lucky days from
that total are the 3d and 9th, and the 9th would be considered doubly
lucky, if no tests worked to the contrary.</p>

<p>The unlucky days are determined in precisely the same manner, by
multiplying the number of days in the month by the number which have
passed previous to a full moon.</p>

<p>After working out your list of lucky days in the manner above
described, you must then test them, in order to be sure that there are
no opposing influences. You can do this by calculating the unlucky
days. Should you find that any day of the month which was designated as
lucky came also in the list of unlucky days the latter preponderates
and you must strike it from the lucky list.</p>

<p>This plan of demonstrating lucky and unlucky days is very ancient,
and has been tested to such an extent that it is considered accurate
by most astrologers. In olden times, before the mass of the people
understood much about figures, the professional fortune-tellers
demanded a large fee for computing the lucky days of any month, which
they accomplished in the manner above described.</p>

<p>Lucky marriage days for girls were cast in the same manner, except
that the age of the girl was used as the multiplicator, or multiplier,
instead of the number of days in the month. The result was determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
similarly, and also by a test of the unlucky days. Thus if a girl is
eighteen years old, and thinks of marrying in October, she takes up
an almanac and ascertains the day of the full moon in that month. If
it occurs on the 24th, and there are thirty-one days in the month
this leaves seven for the multiplier. She multiplies this by her age,
eighteen, and the result is 126, which shows that the lucky days for
her marriage in that month are the 12th and 6th, unless they are
destroyed by another test, which is determined as follows. There are
twenty-three days before the 24th, and she must multiply twenty-three
by eighteen, which process gives 414, and shows that the 4th and 14th
are the only unlucky days for her marriage. And as they do not conflict
with the lucky days, the 6th and 12th may be considered as genuine
lucky days for that month, reckoning the moon to be full on the 24th.
In determining her age, she should reckon any period over half a year
as a full and completed year.</p>

<p>Almost all persons (being of male sex) who are born on the days
included in the foregoing table will—in a greater or less
degree—suffer, not only by pecuniary embarrassments and loss of
property, but will also experience great distress and anxiety troubles
about their children, daughters forming unhappiness in their family
affairs, grave disaffection toward each other among those who are
married, trouble about their children, daughter forming unfortunate
attachments, and a variety of untoward events of other descriptions.
The influences of these days are calculated to excite in the minds
of persons born thereon an extraordinary passion for speculation,
for change in their affairs, for the initiation of new undertakings,
but all of them will tend nearly to one point—loss of property and
pecuniary embarrassments. If such persons embark their capital on
credit in new concerns or engagements, they will be likely to receive
interruptions to the progress of their undertakings. Those who enter
into engagements intended to be permanent—whether purchases, leases,
partnerships or, in short, any other speculation of a description which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
cannot readily be transferred or disposed of—will dearly repent their bargains.</p>

<p>They will find their affairs from time to time much interrupted and
agitated, and will experience many disappointments in money matters,
trouble through bills, and have need of all their activity and address
to prop their declining credit; indeed, almost all engagements and
affairs that are entered into by persons born on any of these days will
receive some sort of check or obstruction. The greater number of such
persons will also be subject to sickness.</p>

<p>The old author from whom these particulars are derived concludes with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the following counsel: “We advise all females born on these days
to be extremely cautious of placing their affections too hastily,
for they will be subject to disappointment and vexations in these
respects. It will be better for them, in such matters, to be guided by
the advice of their friends, rather than by their own feelings; they
will be less fortunate in placing their affections than in any other
action of their lives, as many of their marriages will terminate in
separations, divorces, etc. Their courtships will end in elopements,
seductions and other misfortunes. These statements are drawn from the
best astrological sources, and are given as a warning, that the persons
concerned may avoid certain perplexing labyrinths of destiny, from
which nothing but care and attention can save them.”</p>

<h3>The Derivations of the Names of the Months</h3>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE ANCIENT ORACLES</h2>
</div>

<p>The telling of fortunes and the predicting of the future in ancient
times was the work of the Oracles. In the ancient religions the
Oracle was believed to be a revelation made by some god or divinity
in reply to the questions of men. The word “oracle” was applied both
to the answer and to the sacred place where the answer was given. The
responses were made either by priests and priestesses or by signs and portents.</p>

<p>At the Oracle of Dodona the responses were given either by the
movements of leaves, the noise of brazen vessels, or the murmurings
of the waters of a fountain. Usually springs or grottos of which the
waters were known to have delirious effects were selected for the sites
of the oracles. At Dydima the vapor of the water affected both the
priestess and person who consulted her. At Delphi the priestess, who
was called the “Pythia,” delivered her utterances from a tripod placed
over a chasm, from which intoxicating vapors arose. In some of the
oracles, incense and artificial fumigations were used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The answers of the oracles were famous for their obscurity and lack
of meaning. They were often susceptible of two or more meanings.
When King Crœsus asked of the oracle whether he should make war
against Alexander, the reply was: “If you make war you destroy a
great kingdom.” Crœsus began the war thinking that he would destroy
Alexander, but it was his own kingdom that he destroyed.</p>

<p>The responses of the Pythia were not considered authoritative till they
had been submitted and approved by the presiding priest. Delphi was the
most famous oracle and became the center of all the Greek oracles. Even
the Romans believed in its power.</p>

<p>With the coming of Christianity, the oracles lost much of their
influence. Eusebius affirms that Christ put an end to the reign of
Satan on earth and thereafter the oracles became silent.</p>

<p>In Greece there were altogether twenty-two oracles to Apollo, which
were consulted for various purposes. One was used exclusively for the
interpretation of dreams, another for the foretelling of battles,
still another was consulted by those who went into the Olympian games
to find out whether they would be victorious. At Patræ sick persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
came to inquire whether they would get well. At Nysa the priests would
take patients and induce a cataleptic sleep, during which the sick man
prescribed his own remedy.</p>

<p>It is easy to see why many of the utterances of the oracles came true.
They appealed to the superstition of the primitive people, who took the
replies as coming from their gods, and tried to live up to them. The
will to see the prophecy fulfilled was often sufficient to make it come true.</p>

<h3>Napoleon’s Oraculum</h3>

<p>This well-known method of telling fortunes is exceedingly ancient, and
was a favorite with Napoleon;—hence its name. The usual method was
to mark down four rows of dots at random on a sheet of paper and then
count them. If the first row had an uneven number of dots, one star was
put in the first place, if an even number, two stars were put down,
and so for each of the four rows. The resulting figure gave the key by
which the chart was to be consulted. It often happened, however, that
the questioner consciously or unconsciously regulated the number of
dots to suit his purpose.</p>

<p>A more modern and strictly impartial way is the following: Take any
book. Hold it tightly shut and stick a card at random between two of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
pages. Open the book at those pages, note the first four words on the
upper line of the left-hand page. Count the letters in these four
words. If the first word has an even number place two dots in the first
space, if odd, place only one dot. Then take the second word and place
one or two dots in the same way, and so for the other two words. You
will thus get a symbol that may look as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img class="bbox" src="images/tile_d.jpg" alt="_" width="20" height="40" />&nbsp;&emsp;or&emsp;&nbsp;
    <img class="bbox" src="images/tile_a.jpg" alt="_" width="20" height="41" />&nbsp;&emsp;or&emsp;&nbsp;
   <img class="bbox" src="images/tile_q.jpg" alt="_" width="20" height="41" />&nbsp;.
</div>

<p class="no-indent">These are called the Astral “Keys.” There are 16 possible
constructions or keys. Now ask your question. Turn to the <a href="#oraculum_table">Cabalistic
Chart on page 35</a>. Decide on which of the 16 questions you want to
ask. Note the number opposite that question. Run your finger along
the top of the table till you find the Astral Key which you have just
formed. At the junction of this column with the number line, you will
find a mystic letter which tells you which of the oraculum tables to
consult. For example: You want to ask the question, “Shall I recover my
property?” This you find is No. 6 on the chart; the symbol is
&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="bbox" src="images/tile_m.jpg" alt="_" width="20" height="41" />&nbsp;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Find this symbol, run your finger down the column till it meets with
the line of No. 6, and it gives you the mystic letter A. Turn to the
oraculum table marked A and opposite the same symbol you will find the
reply, “You will not recover your property.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of the book and card plan, four dice may be used in the same
manner. The points indicating the even or uneven numbers of dots in the symbol.</p>

<p>Do not ask a question more than once in any one day. Always begin the
search by reciting the formula:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Oraculum, Oraculum,</i></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Tell true fortune, or be dumb.</i>”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The following are unlucky days, on which none of the questions should
be asked, or any adventure undertaken:</p>

<p class="blockquot2">January 1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 20; February 1, 17, 18; March 14, 16; April
10, 17, 18; May 7, 8; June 17; July 17, 21; August 20, 21; September
10, 18; October 6; November 6, 10; December 6, 11, 15.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FORTUNE-TELLING BY CARDS</h2>
</div>

<h3>The Origin and History of Playing Cards.</h3>

<p>The history of playing cards extends back five hundred years, and
various stories and theories have been mooted as to how and by whom
they were first introduced into Europe. Many Eastern nations—notably
those of India, China, Chaldea and Egypt—possessed cards for
divination and playing purposes which differed both in design and use
from those known in Europe at an early date. It seems from ancient
manuscripts that the wise men of the East regarded cards with great
veneration and ascribed to them mysterious powers. They considered them
mediums of revelation from the celestial powers.</p>

<p>Many authorities hold that playing cards were invented by Europeans. It
is certain that they were known in Italy as early as 1379, and that the
Moors and Saracens introduced them into Spain at an earlier date. The
first cards were called “Nabis,” and the Hebrew word “<i>Nabi</i>” means to
prophesy. This gives weight to the theory that the original intention
of cards was for purposes of divination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest cards of which we have any definite knowledge were called
“Tarots,” which are supposed to have been the invention of a Jewish
astrologer and cabalist. Various explanations are given as to the name.
The science and divination by means of these cards were supposed to
be found in the Egyptian “Book of Thoth,” which Moses learned in the
Egyptian temples and of which he guarded the secret jealously. Outside
of a few packs in some of the museums, there are no tarot cards to
be found. The pictures on them represented priests, popes, jugglers,
emperors, devils and other characters. Later on numerals were added
to the symbolic cards so that games could be played with them. At the
beginning of the fifteenth century, Venice had games of cards composed
of 78 cards, 22 containing symbols and 56 numerals. Later the size of
the pack was reduced to 52 cards.</p>

<h3>Suits and Symbols</h3>

<p>There have always been four suits in use, but the symbols used had
varied in different countries. Originally they were cups, money, swords
and clubs. These are still retained in Italian and Spanish cards. Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
German cards have acorns, leaves, hearts and bells. The French cards
used spades and clubs, hearts and diamonds. The word “spade” comes
from the Italian word meaning a sword. The club sign was adopted from
the three-leaf clover. Many of the packs used last century were very
costly and artistic. They were painted by hand to represent historic characters.</p>

<h3>Mystic Meaning</h3>

<p>To many people a pack of cards comes next in importance to the Bible.
To others they are supposed to be the devil’s own handbooks of
destruction. They have exercised an irresistible fascination over the
minds of men and women of all ages. A great interest attaches to the
many possible combinations to be made from the cards in a pack. It has
been pointed out that—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>The fifty-two cards represent the 52 weeks in the year.</p>
<p>Thirteen cards in each suit represent the 13 lunar months, and the 13 weeks in each quarter.</p>
<p>The four suits represent the four seasons of the year.</p>
<p>The twelve court cards represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac.

<h3>The Charm and Power of Cards</h3>

<p>We have nothing to do in this book with cards used for gambling
purposes, but as instruments of Cartomancy we find them full of charm
and interest. Every person has a certain amount of superstition in his
nature and desires to take a look into the dim and mysterious future.
No one need be ashamed of confessing a certain amount of interest in
the unseen and occult. Strange coincidences are happening all the time,
and there are many inexplicable occurrences that meet us at every
turn. Educated men and women are taking an interest in the occult to a
greater extent than ever before, altho in the past the great statesmen
and famous women of France, even the great Napoleon himself, were
believers in the power of cards to foretell the future. Divination by
cards is of great antiquity and is still as popular as ever. Formerly
it was connected with astrologers’ incantation and religious practices.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Now, however, it is indulged in principally as a means of amusement.
Of course no one need be warned against the danger of taking a pack
of cards as a guide in matters of importance requiring judgment and discretion.</p>

<h3>What the Cards Signify</h3>

<p>There are several systems of telling fortunes by cards. In each the
meaning of the cards and the mode of laying them out differ. The
meaning of a card is modified when the card is reversed. As our modern
packs are practically the same, looking at them from either end, it is
well to mark the cards so that you can tell which is the top and which
is the bottom. This could be done before starting to use the pack.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Meaning of the Various Cards.</span></h3>

<p>Hearts are especially connected with the work of Cupid and Hymen. The
suit has also close reference to affairs of the home and to both the
domestic and social sides of life.</p>

<p>Diamonds are representative of financial matters, small and great, with
a generally favorable signification.</p>

<p>Clubs stand for prosperity, a happy home life with intelligent
pleasures and successful undertakings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Spades forebode evil. They speak of sickness, death, monetary losses
and anxieties, separation from friends and dear ones. They are also
representative of love, appealing exclusively to the senses.</p>

a lover. If reversed, they mean foolish excess.</p>

<p><i>Two Aces.</i>—These mean union: if Hearts and Clubs, it will be for

jealousy. If reversed, the object of the union will fail.</p>

<p><i>Four Kings.</i>—Honors, preferment, good appointments. If reversed, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

obstacle. Both reversed spell failure.</p>

<p><i>Four Queens.</i>—A social gathering which may be spoilt by one or more
being reversed.</p>

<p><i>Three Queens.</i>—Friendly visits. If reversed, scandal, gossip and
possibly bodily danger.</p>

<p><i>Two Queens.</i>—Interchanged, secrets betrayed, a meeting between
friends. When both are reversed, there will be suffering for the
inquirer resulting from his own acts. Only one reversed, means rivalry.</p>

<p><i>Four Knaves.</i>—Jolly conviviality. Any of them reversed lessens the
evil.</p>

<p><i>Three Knaves.</i>—Worries and vexations from acquaintances, slander
calling the inquirer’s honor in question. If reversed, it foretells a
passage-at-arms with a social inferior.</p>

<p><i>Two Knaves.</i>—Loss of goods. If both are reversed, the trouble is
imminent; if one only, it is near.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Combinations of Plain Cards.</span></h4>

<p><i>Four Tens.</i>—Good fortune, success. The more there are reversed,
the greater number of obstacles in the way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Three Tens.</i>—Ruin brought about by lawsuits. When reversed, the evil
is decreased.</p>

<p><i>Two Tens.</i>—Unexpected luck, which may be connected with a change
of occupation. If one be reversed, it will come soon; if both are
reversed, it is distant.</p>

<p><i>Four Nines.</i>—Unexpected events. The number that are reversed stand
for the time to elapse.</p>

<p><i>Three Nines.</i>—Health, wealth and happiness. If reversed, it means
financial difficulties caused by imprudence.</p>

<p><i>Two Nines.</i>—Prosperity and contentment accompanied by business
matters. If reversed, small worries.</p>

<p><i>Four Eights.</i>—Attending a journey or the taking up of a new position.

<p><i>Three Eights.</i>—Thoughts of love and marriage, new family ties. If
reversed, flirtation and foolishness.</p>

<p><i>Two Eights.</i>—Pleasures and passing love fancies. If reversed,
disappointments.</p>

<p><i>Four Sevens.</i>—Schemes and contention and opposition. If reversed,
failure of same.</p>

<p><i>Three Sevens.</i>—Loss of friends, ill-health, remorse. If reversed,
slight ailments or unpleasant reaction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Two Sevens.</i>—Mutual love and marriage. If reversed,
faithlessness or regret.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">General Information.</span></h4>

<p>When a number of court cards fall together it is a sign of hospitality,
festive social intercourse, and gaiety of all kinds.</p>

<p>Married people who seek to read the cards must represent their own
life partner by the king or queen of the suit they have chosen for
themselves, regardless of anything else. For example, a very dark man,
the King of Spades, must consider his wife represented by the Queen of Spades.</p>

<p>Bachelors and spinsters may choose cards to personate their lovers and
friends.</p>

<p>A court card placed between two cards of the same grade—for instance,
two nines, two sevens, etc.—shows that the one represented by that
card is threatened.</p>

<p>Should a military man consult the cards he must always be represented
by the King of Diamonds.</p>

<p>It is always essential to cut cards with the left hand, there being a
long-established idea that it is more intimately connected with the
heart than the right. A round table is generally preferred by those who
are in the habit of practising cartomancy. It is a matter of opinion as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to whether the cards speak with the same clearness and accuracy when
consulted by the inquirer without a fortune-teller. The services of
an expert are generally supposed to be of great advantage, even when
people have mastered the rudiments of cartomancy themselves.</p>

<h3>Telling One’s Fortune with Twenty-one Cards</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Italian Method.</span></h4>

<p>Thirty-two cards are actually required for this method, altho only 21
of them are used. After shuffling the cards and cutting with the left
hand, the fortune-teller counts off the first 11 cards and lays them
aside. From the 21 which are left he takes the top card and lays it
apart, then he lays out the other 20 on the table before him. One card
must represent the inquirer, either a knave or a queen, according to
the sex. If this card is not among the 20 cards on the table the pack
must be dealt over. The meaning of the cards must then be considered;
if any set of 2, 3 or more of a kind occur their meaning should be read
also, as it may modify the general interpretation of the rest. The 20
cards should be read from left to right continuously to let each card
continue the meaning of the one before. The cards must then be put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
together again and shuffled and cut as before. The top card is again
laid aside and the others divided into 3 packs, of which 2 contain
7 cards each and the last only 6 cards. The inquirer chooses one of
the packs, which is next turned with the face up and one after the
other the cards are to be read according to their significance. This
operation must be repeated 3 times.</p>

<p>The following will give an example of how these cards are to be manipulated:</p>

<p>Let us take the Knave of Clubs as representing the inquirer, and the
21 cards selected are the following in their regular order: King of
Spades, Queen of Hearts (reversed), Ace of Hearts, Knave of Clubs, Ace
of Spades (reversed), Ace of Clubs, Knave of Hearts, King of Hearts,
Queen of Spades (reversed), Nine of Hearts, Knave of Diamonds, Ten
of Spades, Ace of Diamonds (reversed), King of Diamonds, Seven of
Diamonds, Eight of Diamonds, Eight of Spades (reversed), Seven of Clubs
(reversed), Nine of Clubs (reversed), Nine of Diamonds. The Surprise
placed apart.</p>

<p>On examining this list carefully we find there are 4 Aces, which
indicate danger and financial loss. The fact that one of them is
reversed shows that the trouble is somewhat lightened.</p>

<p>There are 3 Kings, which indicate that important matters will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
undertaken and carried thru successfully by the inquirer.</p>

<p>There are 2 Queens, both reversed, which show that the young man may
suffer thru his own faults.</p>

<p>There are 3 Knaves, which mean more worries and vexations thru which
the inquirer’s honor may be at stake.</p>

<p>Three Nines, however, are indicative of happiness and wealth, altho
there will be difficulties to overcome.</p>

<p>The 2 Eights indicate some love interest and flirtation.</p>

<p>And the 2 Sevens speak of mutual love and marriage, altho one being
reversed adds an element of regret.</p>

<p>We will now follow the cards as they lie before us from left to right:</p>

<p>The King of Spades is an unscrupulous man who is a dangerous enemy and
will cause trouble.</p>

<p>The Queen of Hearts, reversed, speaks of a woman who, while
good-natured, has had an unlucky love affair and on whom the inquirer
has set his heart.</p>

<p>The Ace of Hearts indicates that a love letter containing good news
will be sent to her by the inquirer.</p>

<p>The Knave of Clubs, a clever young fellow, is mixed up in the affair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
but some grief may affect his health as indicated by the Ace of Spades,
while the Ace of Clubs, coming immediately after, shows that this
sorrow may have something to do with money matters.</p>

<p>The 3 court cards which follow are indicative of a good time in which
the inquirer will have to deal with the Knave of Hearts, who is a young
bachelor devoted to enjoyments, the King of Hearts a man of generous
disposition, and the Queen of Spades, reversed, a dark, intriguing woman.</p>

<p>The Nine of Hearts shows that the inquirer will have good luck and
pleasure, but the Knave of Diamonds, following immediately after, shows
that an untrustworthy friend is trying to bring him to trouble.</p>

<p>The Ten of Spades means considerable worry and is followed by the Ace
of Diamonds, reversed, which also indicates bad tidings in which the
King of Diamonds, an old soldier with a deceitful turn of mind and who
has a grievance against the inquirer, will have recourse to scandal and
slander, as indicated by the Seven of Diamonds.</p>

<p>Next comes the Eight of Diamonds, which shows that the inquirer will
indulge in love-making, but he is in for considerable worry as his
offer of marriage will be rejected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The Seven of Clubs tells him that money matters will also cause worry
until the Nine of Clubs, reversed, indicates that a gift of money will
relieve the situation somewhat. However, there will still be vexatious
hindrances, as indicated by the Nine of Diamonds.</p>

<p>The “Surprise” may now be turned up, and contains, let us say, the King
of Clubs—a warm-hearted, true friend, straight in his dealings, thru
whom happiness and prosperity may come to the inquirer.</p>

<h4><i>The Significance of the Three Packs.</i></h4>

<p>As before stated, after having read these cards as a continuous
message, the cards must be again shuffled and cut into three packs.
The inquirer is asked to choose one of the packs. We will take it for
granted that he takes the middle pack, containing 7 cards. Let us say,
for example, that this pack contains the following cards: Knave of
Diamonds, Seven of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs, Queen of Spades (reversed),
Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, Eight of Diamonds. Reading these cards,
we notice three Aces, which indicate a lot of trouble—possibly a
faithless lover—to be followed by good news. The Knave of Diamonds, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
untrustworthy friend mixed up in a scandal which is shown by the Seven
of Diamonds, and is brought about by a letter relating to money, as
shown by the Ace of Clubs. A widow with an intriguing mind, shown by
the Queen of Spades, has something to do in this trouble. The Ace of
Spades foretells enjoyment—probably an offer of marriage or a letter,
as indicated by the Ace of Diamonds. The Eight of Diamonds foretells a
happy marriage after all these troubles.</p>

<p>The inquirer now selects another pack, which is to be read in the same
manner, and finally the third pack is to be similarly interpreted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The French System.</span></h3>

<p>Thirty-two cards are required, rejecting all under the Sevens. They
must be shuffled and cut as usual and divided into two packs of 16
each. The inquirer chooses one of the packs, and the first card is
laid aside for the “Surprise.” The remaining 15 cards are turned face
upward and laid on the table from left to right. A certain card must
be selected to represent the inquirer. And this must be in the pack he
selects. If not, the division must be gone over again until this card
is found in the selected pack.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Method of Reading.</i></h4>

<p>If there are any 2, 3 or 4 of a kind their explanation must first be
given. Next start from the card representing the inquirer and count in
groups of 7 from right to left. Next, pair the end cards together and
read their meaning. After this shuffle the 15 cards again and divide
them into three packs of 5 cards each. The top card of each is first
removed and placed with the other which has been set apart as the
“Surprise.” This will leave three packs of 4 cards each. Inquirer then
chooses one of the packs, and the 4 cards are laid out on the table
from left to right and their meaning is read. The left-hand pack is
“for the house,” the right-hand pack “for those who do not expect,” and
the remaining pack is “for the surprise.”</p>

<p>Let us suppose, for example, that the inquirer, being a woman, is
represented by the Queen of Clubs. She chooses the middle of the three
packs, which contains the Knave of Clubs, Eight of Diamonds (reversed),
Eight of Hearts, Queen of Clubs. These will be read as follows: “A
clever young man is ardent in his love and is flirting with the
inquirer. He has thoughts of marriage in which the inquirer plays a
very important part. And the prospects are favorable.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The next pack, which is “for the house,” may have the following cards:
Knave of Spades, Ace of Spades, Knave of Hearts, King of Spades. They
are read as follows: There are 3 Spades, which indicate disappointment.
Two Knaves coming together indicate loss of goods and other trouble.
The Knave of Spades indicates a legal gentleman of not very refined
character who is employed by his master, an unscrupulous lawyer, as
shown by the King of Spades, and who is an enemy of the inquirer. A
young bachelor devoted to pleasure, however, will help the inquirer out
of difficulty. The next pack, which is for “those who do not expect,”
is, we will say, composed of the Queen of Hearts, Ten of Spades, Ace
of Clubs, Nine of Clubs. These indicate that a fair-haired lady, who
has had considerable grief, will bring letters relating to money to
the inquirer, possibly an unlooked-for inheritance which will change
the career of the inquirer. In the case of a merchant, it may mean new customers.</p>

<p>Finally comes the pack “The Surprise,” in which we will find The Ace
of Hearts, Queen of Spades, Nine of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts. These are
read as follows: “A love letter with the best of news will be received.
A dark-haired lady will throw hindrances and trouble into the path of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the inquirer, in spite of which happiness and success will be the final outcome.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">An English System of Telling the Past, Present and Future.</span></h3>

<p>We will present an easy and generally accepted method of telling
fortunes by means of cards. Thirty-two cards are required, which are
shuffled and cut in the usual way. After being cut, the top card of the
lower pack and the bottom card of the upper pack are laid aside and
form the “Surprise,” then the packs are placed one upon the other. This
leaves 30 cards, which are dealt into three equal parts; the pack at
the left representing the <i>past</i>, the one in the middle the <i>present</i>,
and the one to the right the <i>future</i>.</p>

<p>The man or woman wishing to know what Fortune has in store is called
the “Inquirer”; he is represented by a card (supposing him to be a man)
which we will say is the Knave of Hearts. Let us now suppose that the
ten cards representing the <i>past</i> are as follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub5">Ace of Clubs&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;(reversed)</li>
<li class="isub5">King of Spades</li>
<li class="isub5">Knave of Diamonds</li>
<li class="isub5">King of Clubs</li>
<li class="isub5">Nine of Hearts
                  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></li>
<li class="isub5">Ten of Spades.</li>
<li class="isub5">Seven of Spades&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;(reversed)</li>
<li class="isub5">Eight of Spades&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp; (reversed)</li>
<li class="isub5">Seven of Clubs.</li>
<li class="isub5">Nine of Clubs.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we refer to the meaning of the cards as already given, we will find
the following as to the man’s past:</p>

<p>The Ace of Clubs shows that happiness has been of short duration.</p>

<p>The King of Spades denotes that an unscrupulous friend has been at work.</p>

<p>The Knave of Diamonds shows that this man has been a mischief-maker.</p>

<p>The King of Clubs indicates that a warm heart and true friend have been
of considerable assistance.</p>

<p>The Nine of Hearts shows that this man has brought good luck.</p>

<p>The Ten of Spades indicates that there has been considerable grief and
some loss of freedom due to circumstances over which the inquirer had
no control.</p>

<p>The Seven of Spades (reversed) shows that silly love-making has cast
its influence over the inquirer.</p>

<p>The Eight of Spades (reversed) shows, however, that the engagement has
been canceled or rejected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The Seven of Clubs indicates that trifling financial matters have at
times made life sorrowful.</p>

<p>The Nine of Clubs indicates that this financial condition will be
solved by an unlooked-for inheritance.</p>

<p>The next pack being in the center represents the <i>present</i>, and we
find, perhaps, that the cards run as follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub5">Ace of Diamonds</li>
<li class="isub5">Ten of Diamonds</li>
<li class="isub5">Knave of Hearts&emsp;&nbsp;(reversed)</li>
<li class="isub5">King of Hearts&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp; (reversed)</li>
<li class="isub5">Seven of Diamonds</li>
<li class="isub5">Nine of Spades</li>
<li class="isub5">Eight of Hearts</li>
<li class="isub5">Queen of Hearts</li>
<li class="isub5">Seven of Hearts</li>
<li class="isub5">Queen of Diamonds&nbsp;&nbsp;(reversed).</li>
</ul>

<p>The reading of the cards will be as follows:</p>

<p>The Ace of Diamonds denotes the coming of an offer of marriage or a letter.</p>

<p>The Ten of Diamonds, following immediately after, indicates that the
letter is about a voyage or a removal.</p>

<p>This is followed by the Knave of Hearts, and indicates that it is a
question of a young bachelor who is devoted to enjoyment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Being followed by the King of Hearts (reversed), it indicates that his
dealings with the inquirer will be very disappointing.</p>

<p>The Seven of Diamonds, which follows, explains that the inquirer will
come in for considerable unkindly chaff.</p>

<p>The Nine of Spades (reversed) foretells a loss of one that is near and
dear, thru death.</p>

<p>The Eight of Hearts, which follows, tells that the inquirer is
harboring an affection for a fair lady. She is revealed to us in the
Queen of Hearts as a good-natured, lovable woman who, according to the
Seven of Hearts, is quietly and contentedly awaiting developments.</p>

<p>The Queen of Diamonds (reversed) tells him to beware of a woman who is
a spiteful flirt and apt to make trouble.</p>

<p>The third pack represents the <i>future</i>, and we have the following cards:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub5">Queen of Clubs</li>
<li class="isub5">King of Diamonds</li>
<li class="isub5">Eight of Diamonds</li>
<li class="isub5">Ten of Clubs</li>
<li class="isub5">Nine of Diamonds</li>
<li class="isub5">Eight of Clubs</li>
<li class="isub5">Ace of Diamonds&emsp;&nbsp;(reversed)</li>
<li class="isub5">Ace of Hearts&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; (reversed)
                  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></li>
<li class="isub5">Knave of Spades&emsp;&nbsp;(reversed)</li>
<li class="isub5">Queen of Spades&emsp;&nbsp;(reversed)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Queen of Clubs indicates a dark-haired woman, rather loving but apt
to cause trouble.</p>

<p>The King of Diamonds is an old man who is also inclined to make mischief.</p>

<p>The Eight of Diamonds shows that there have been some love passages
between the inquirer and the lady which may develop into a romance,
which, according to the Ten of Clubs, promises to be prosperous.</p>

<p>The Nine of Diamonds, however, shows that all will not be smooth
sailing, for, according to the Eighth of Clubs, a dark-haired man is also
paying attention to this woman and may make headway in his attentions.</p>

<p>According to the Ace of Diamonds (reversed) the inquirer must be
prepared for evil tidings.</p>

<p>The Ace of Hearts (reversed) foretells a visit from a friend, which the
Knave of Spades (reversed) shows is a medical student, not of the most
refined character.</p>

<p>The Queen of Spades (reversed) shows that an unscrupulous and spiteful
woman is weaving her spell around the inquirer, and he had better beware.</p>

<p>Again examining the cards of the <i>future</i>, we find two Queens, one
reversed, which means rivalry between the women influencing this fortune.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
There are also two Eights, which indicate intrigue and opposition.</p>

<p>This is but a brief summary of the way in which this method is
worked. A great deal depends, of course, upon the cleverness of the
fortune-teller in interpreting the cards according to the disposition
of the inquirer.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Gypsy Method.</span></h3>

<p>A very simple method, especially when there are many fortunes to be
told, which is often used by the Romany folks, is the following.
In this method the meanings are somewhat different from those
given in previous chapters. These new meanings may better suit the
characteristics of the inquirer, and in connection with the readings
already given they add many facts of importance.</p>

<p>Thirty-two cards are taken, the numbers under 7 being thrown out. The
cards are shuffled and cut into three packs by the inquirer, each pack
being turned face up. The center pack is taken first, then the one to
the right, finally the one to the left, and placed upon each other in
this position. The fortune-teller holds this newly arranged pack in his
left hand and takes off 3 cards facing upwards, selecting the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
card of any suit that may appear. He retains this one and lays the
others aside for the next deal. Continue doing this until the pack is
finished. Then shuffle all the discarded cards together, until you have
21 cards or more on the table. If 3 cards of any suit appear, or 3
cards of the same value, they must all be taken.</p>

<p>A card must now be selected to represent the inquirer. If she be fair
of complexion she selects Diamonds; if medium fair, Hearts; if of brown
hair, she selects Clubs; and if very dark, Spades. A man selects the
King and a woman the Queen. This representative card is shuffled with
the others and taken out when it is the highest of its suit. Should
there be 21 or more cards selected before it appears, then it must be
taken from the remainder and placed last of all.</p>

<p>The cards are read from left to right, and are placed in horseshoe
shape as they are drawn out. Picture cards represent people, and the
number of spots relates to money or events. Diamonds concern themselves
with money and interest; Hearts, with love affairs and affection; Clubs,
with business events; and Spades, with the more serious affairs of life.</p>

<p>The following gives the significance of each card:

<p>Three Kings coming together indicate a new friend; a Knave and 2 Kings,
meeting an old friend; 3 Knaves, business at law; 3 Queens, a quarrel
with a woman; 3 Tens, a lucky deal. If the Ten of Hearts, Ten of Clubs
and Ten of Diamonds come together, it means that a wealthy marriage
will follow a journey across the sea. Three Nines indicate good news;
3 Eights, a removal; 3 Sevens, unsatisfactory news; 3 Aces, very good
luck. An Ace of Clubs and of Diamonds together, a letter which will
bring an offer of marriage. The Ace and Nine of Hearts indicate that a
desire will be realized at home; the Ace and Nine of Spades foretell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
death and sorrow in your family; the King, Queen and Ten of any suit
mean that you will hear of a marriage soon.</p>

<h4><i>Reading the Cards</i></h4>

<p>Let us now take a typical example of this method. Let the inquirer be
represented by the Queen of Hearts. Shuffle and divide the pack into
3, giving the King, Knave and Seven of Hearts, indicating that the
inquirer has a male friend of medium complexion and good intentions.
Lay these 3 cards in order beginning with the left hand. The
fortune-teller now proceeds to draw off 3 cards, making his selection
as above explained. Having finished the pack, he repeats the process
twice more. We will suppose that in these deals the following cards
have been selected:</p>

<p>King, Knave, Seven of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, King of Spades, Queen of
Clubs, Queen of Diamonds, Queen of Spades, King of Clubs, Knave of
Diamonds, Ace of Hearts, Knave of Spades, King of Diamonds, Knave of
Clubs, Queen of Hearts, Ace of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts, Eight of Clubs,
Seven of Spades, Ace of Spades, Ten of Clubs, Ten of Spades and Ten of
Diamonds.</p>

<p>Beginning from the Queen of Hearts, as the starting-point, we proceed
to count 7 to the left. The seventh card being the Queen of Spades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the seventh from this is the King of Hearts, and again counting to the
seventh we get the Ten of Hearts.</p>

<p>This is to be read as follows:</p>

<p>The inquirer has many good friends, but the Queen of Spades represents
a woman who will interpose difficulties to her marriage, but without
effect. The next card is the Knave of Diamonds followed by the Seven
of Hearts and the Seven of Spades; which combination represents news
coming soon, but which may not be advantageous to the inquirer. The
Knave of Spades is followed by the King and Ten of Clubs, which denotes
that a dark man is separated from the inquirer, but thinks of her and
hopes to be with her soon.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Creole Method</span></h3>

<p>You will no doubt remember the fascinating story of how Josephine, the
wife of Napoleon I. and Empress of France, had her fortune told when
still a girl. She was a Creole—that is a native of the West Indies and
of French descent. Tradition tells us that she went to an old colored
witch, who laid out the cards according to the Creole system and from
them prophesied, “You will be greater than a queen.” Josephine at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
had faith in this prediction, but after waiting for a king to propose
to her, she married a French soldier named Beauharnais, by whom she had
two children. He died during the early part of the French Revolution.
Napoleon, who at that time was a poor lieutenant, deeply in debt and
without prospects, proposed to her. He did not seem likely to carry out
the prophecy and raise her to be more than queen; so she refused him.
At last she was won over by his persistency and married him. In the
course of years she became Empress of France.</p>

<p>Just what the Creole method of divination was had been forgotten for
many years. The following system, however, has recently been declared
by an old gypsy of Martinique to be the exact method used by the
fortune-teller of Josephine. It will not be found in any other book. It
will be interesting principally because it differs materially from all
the methods given in other books on cartomancy.</p>

<p>Begin by shuffling all the 52 cards thoroughly. The inquirer then cuts
them and takes the pack in his left hand, first holding it on his
forehead and saying, “Que le cerveau parle!” which means, “Let the
Brain speak,”—then holding it over the heart, saying, “Que le cœur
décide!” or in English, “Let the Heart decide.” The operator then takes
the cards and spreads them fanwise before her on the table, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
backs up. The inquirer then draws out at random the mystic number of
9 cards, arranging them as follows, face up:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/creole_method.jpg" alt="HOROSCOPE" width="400" height="423" />
</div>

<p>The first card is called the “Key Card,” for it decides the
interpretation to be put on the rest. If it is a Heart, it foretells
the height of success; if a Diamond, it foretells wealth; if a Spade,
it brings misfortune; if a Club, it denotes hard work. The next two
cards decide the time in which the fortune will be determined. The low
spots indicate a short space, the higher spots, a longer space of time.
The court cards indicate a remote fortune, but a happy one. The next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
three cards indicate the rank or station to which Fortune will elevate
the inquirer. If court cards, the Fates will be kind; if ordinary or
low cards, the inquirer will have to be content with mediocrity. The
Ace means disgrace or, at best, a very low station.</p>

<p>The next two cards denote the course of married life. If court cards,
the marital relations will be happy; if low cards, there will be
trouble and friction, The Ace means unhappiness at home. The last card
is devoted to health. A court card means the best of health; the lower,
more or less serious illness, according to the degree indicated by
their spots. The Ace means an early death. The cards that were drawn by
Josephine were (so we are informed):</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="2" summary="_" cellpadding="6">
  <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc">King of Hearts</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">Ten of Diamonds&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;Nine of Diamonds</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">Queen of Hearts&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;Queen of Diamonds&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;Queen of Clubs</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">King of Diamonds&nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;King of Clubs</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc">Ten of Hearts</td>
    </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>It will be seen that every card denotes the height of fortune—a
combination that is rarely met with. After reading the mystic nine, the
remaining cards are again shuffled and the inquirer draws out thirteen cards at
random from the pack. These are arranged in the form of a cross as shown in the diagram.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/creole_cross.jpg" alt="HOROSCOPE" width="400" height="455" />
</div>

<p>Put the first card in the center and the remaining cards to left,
right, top and bottom as indicated by the numbers. The reading of the
cards is as follows:</p>

<p>Hearts denote love; Diamonds, wealth; Clubs, hard work; and Spades, misfortune.</p>

<p>Of the court cards, Kings are lucky for women inquirers and Queens for
men. Knaves are lucky if red and unlucky if black.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ace is always a sign of coming evil.</p>

<p>The odd numbers are lucky for men and unlucky for women, and the even
numbers are the reverse. A 2-spot means a gift; a 3-spot, a letter;
a 4-spot, news; a 5-spot, an accident; a 6-spot, a change; a 7-spot,
friendship; an 8-spot, assistance; a 9-spot, home conditions; a
10-spot, business conditions.</p>

<p>Let us suppose the cards just laid out in a cross are the following:</p>

      <td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tdl">Two of Clubs</td> <td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>This we would read as follows, the inquirer being a lady:</p>

<p>The Knave of Hearts denotes luck in love; probably a suitor if the
inquirer be unmarried, or a loving husband if the inquirer be married.</p>

<p>The Ten of Clubs indicates that business conditions will soon improve,
for an even number is lucky for ladies. The Ace of Spades shows a very
dark and pressing trouble that threatens. Three of Diamonds shows that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
money will be lost by a foolish transaction. Eight of Hearts shows that
fortunate assistance will be at hand. Ten of Hearts means that through
friendship the business conditions will have greatly improved.</p>

<p>The King of Spades means that a dark man will have a disagreeable
effect upon the inquirer, and the Queen of Spades, the man’s wife, will
be instrumental in making things unpleasant. Be careful not to get into
their bad graces.</p>

<p>The Four of Hearts indicates welcome news from a dear friend. The
Seven of Diamonds shows that this friendship will bring gain of money
as well. Knave of Spades means, “Beware of a treacherous man who is
disposed to do you harm!” The Two of Clubs means an unexpected gift
from a business man, or possibly a gain through hard luck. Other
interpretations may be put on these cards according to the temperament
of the fortune-teller.</p>

<p>A modification of this method is to draw 21 cards instead of 13.
Arrange 12 of these in the form of a semicircle, and the other 9 in the
form of a triangle within the circle. To discover the past, read the
circle first from left to right. Then to predict the future, read the
triangle beginning at the left-hand angle, going up to the apex, down
on the right-hand side, and across the base.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Card Oracles.</span></h3>

<p>Answering questions by means of cards is a popular pastime. If the
inquirer wishes to know—</p>

<p class="center space-above1">“<i>When will my wedding be?</i>”</p>

<p>she draws four cards and lays them face up on the table. The spots must
be counted to get the number of weeks. A Queen or King means a speedy
marriage with prosperity. A Knave means a delay. An Ace signifies trouble
and bids the inquirer consider well before taking the important step.</p>

<p class="center space-above1">“<i>Will my lover be true to me?</i>”</p>

<p>Lay the top 15 cards on the table face up. If the Ten, Nine or Eight of
Hearts is among them, the chances are favorable. If the Ace of Spades
is among them, the omen is bad. If the King of Hearts turns up, you can
trust him for life.</p>

<p class="center space-above1">“<i>Have I cause for jealousy?</i>”</p>

<p>Count off the top 9 cards. If the Ace of any suit is among them,
beware, for there is someone he loves better than you.</p>

<p class="center space-above1">“<i>Shall we ever part?</i>”</p>

<p>Lay out 4 cards from the top in the form of a cross. Count the spots.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
If odd, then you will never part; if even, be prepared for a short
parting in the future. If an Ace is among them, the parting will be a long one.</p>

<p class="center space-above1">“<i>Is it advisable for me to change my residence?</i>”</p>

<p>Lay 9 cards in a circle face up. If the middle card is a picture card,
remain where you are. If a small card, the number of spots indicate in
how many months you should move. If an Ace, it indicates the need of
great care.</p>

<p class="center space-above1">“<i>What fortune is there in store for me?</i>”</p>

<p>Take off 3 cards and lay them face up. If red cards, they foretell a
good fortune; if black, trouble. If a King or Queen appears, it means
that influential friends will help. If a Knave, beware of an enemy. If
an Ace, you will have a struggle to achieve success.

<h2 class="nobreak">Fortune-telling with Dice and Dominoes</h2>
</div>

<p>A very ancient and fascinating way of telling one’s fortune is by
means of two dice, and the following tables make the game easy and
interesting. We have confined ourselves to twenty questions, comprising
those which would most naturally occur to inquirers desiring to know the future.</p>

<p>Two dice are used. The inquirer first selects the question to be
answered, and calling this question aloud, takes the dice either in his
palms or in a cup, and throws them on the table. The number of spots
of the upper surface of the dice are noted, the corresponding table
of answers is consulted, and the answer corresponds in number to the
question asked.</p>

<p>If, for example, a lady has chosen the question 5, “How many beaux
shall I have?” and the dice fall with numbers 2 and 3 facing upward,
the answer would be, “Perhaps one, possibly none.” The same plan is
adopted with dominoes, except that all stones containing blanks must
first be thrown out. The dominoes are laid with the backs upward, mixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
thoroughly, and one at a time selected, and turned over. The number of
spots indicate which table of answers is to be consulted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SCIENCE OF PALMISTRY<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[A]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>If we regard either hand closely, we notice that the surface of the
fingers and palms consists of elevations, depressions and lines. The
ancients gave these different formations separate names to which they
attached certain meanings.</p>

<p>For the purpose of divination the science of palmistry is of great
importance, because it is these selfsame lines and elevations in the
palm which betray the character and disposition of its possessor. The
old notion that they also disclose his future has been discarded by
modern authorities.</p>

<p>The lines on the palm remain unchangeable and irremovable. This has
been often proved in the cases where through accident the palm happened
to become disfigured; even where the entire skin came off, it was
observed that these delicately indented lines which seemed to be only
in the superficial layer of the skin were in reality indelibly stamped
into the tissues of the hand, and the new skin bore them in the same manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The Line of Life and the Line of Fate are the only ones to undergo any
change, and they are also the lines which, though unable to hint the
future, clearly show the earliest past and the direction which the
possessor should pursue. But despite some pretensions to the effect, it
is impossible to tell whether the objects sought for will be reached.
When it is desired to do that the other lines which are unchangeable
must be called to assistance. For instance, if the Line of Character is
strong and well defined, the palmist assumes that the object will be
accomplished, and <i>vice versa</i>. As may be seen, this method is one of
probabilities rather than positive truths.</p>

<p>The chief value of palm-reading consists in the helpful suggestions
which it offers to the conscientious psychic in his efforts to unravel
the future of his client.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>
<a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
<i>The significance of the lines and mountains of the hands are compiled from several
old and authentic treatises on Palmistry.</i></p></div>

<h3>Principal Lines of the Palm and Their Meaning</h3>

<p>1. <i>The Line of Life</i>, which begins over the ball of the palm, may with
equal reason be called the line of the heart, because it furnishes
the skillful palmist with information concerning the heart as well
as concerning long life. If this line is long, firm, continuous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it indicates continued good health and a strong heart. It shows
cheerfulness and old age. If the line is discontinued, cut transversely
with short lines, interrupted with small indentions, spots and warts,
and in addition has a pale color, it signifies poor health and heart
trouble. If the line is weak and thin at the beginning, but grows
stronger toward the end, it means that its possessor is not healthy
in his youth, but will acquire robust health as he grows older. If
the line begins firmly and then tapers off toward the end, just the
opposite meaning is to be deduced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/palmistry_lines.jpg" alt="PALMISTRY LINES." width="400" height="580" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
If the Line of Life issues a branch opposite the index finger and
pointing to it, it presages honor and riches for the possessor.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Line of Fate or Fortune</i>, so called because its peculiar
formation holds the secret of the possessor’s fortune, which secret may
be disclosed only by the skillful palmist—runs from the wrist toward
the fingers. If the line begins at the ball of the palm, it signifies
success in love and a rich marriage. But if it begins toward the end
of the hand, it signifies success in one’s journeys and in foreign
countries. Should the line reach the first joint of the middle finger,
it signifies good results, but at the same time it also betrays greed
and selfishness.</p>

<p>If little twigs issue from the main line they indicate riches and
legacies, according to the number of the twigs; while departing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
branches, on the other hand, show poverty and sometimes imprisonment.</p>

<p>A skillful palmist does not have to see the actual hand in order to
give a correct reading. An impression of the palm on a sheet of smoked
paper, which is afterward covered with oil in order to retain the
impression, shows him the main line with sufficient distinctness to
enable him to give a correct reading.</p>

<h3>The Shape and Length of the Phalanges</h3>

<p class="no-indent">represent certain qualities and features of character,
as presented in the following:</p>

<p><i>Jupiter</i>, the first finger.—If the first phalanx is longer than the
second, it indicates ability to control others, direct and maintain
order; if the second phalanx is long and well developed, it indicates
leadership; if short and thin, intellectual weakness; if the third
phalanx is long, it indicates love of power in material things.</p>

<p><i>Saturn</i>, second finger.—If the first phalanx is longer than the
second, it indicates ability for mastering scientific subjects; if
the second phalanx is long, it indicates great interest in subjects
requiring deep study; if the third phalanx is long, it indicates a love
of metaphysics and money.</p>

<p><i>Sun</i>, third finger.—If the first phalanx is longer than the second,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it indicates love of the arts; if the second phalanx is long, it
indicates success and love of riches; if the third phalanx is thick, it
indicates an inherited talent for the arts.</p>

<p><i>Mercury</i>, fourth finger.—If the first phalanx is longer than the
second, it indicates a taste for and love of research; if the second
phalanx is long and well developed, it indicates industrious habits;
if the third phalanx is long and fat, it indicates a desire for the
comforts of life.</p>

<p>The following points, upon which the science of Palmistry is based explain
its mysteries, and will be found very interesting, amusing and instructive.</p>

<h3>Form of the Hand</h3>

<p>Hands are classed in seven types:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Elementary or Bilious Hand</i>, indicating brutal instinct instead
of reason as the governing power of the character.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Square or Jupiter Hand</i>, indicating a practical, stubborn,
methodical and conventional character; one apt to be suspicious of
strangers and radical in views.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Spatulate or Nervous Hand</i>, so named because of its imagined
resemblance to a spatula. It is broad at the base of the fingers,
and indicates great energy and push to discover; also courage and fearlessness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>The Philosophic or Venus Hand</i> has a long, thin, muscular palm,
with long fingers; indicates a student of nature and searcher after truth.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Mercury or Artistic Hand</i> indicates quick temper,
impulsiveness; a character that is light-hearted, gay and charitable,
today; and tomorrow, sad, tearful and uncharitable.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Lunar or Idealistic Hand</i> indicates an extremely sensitive nature.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Harmonic or Solar Hand</i> indicates a character of great
versatility, brilliant in conversation, and an adept in diplomacy.</p>

<h3>Character from the Shape of a Hand and Fingers</h3>

<p>The shape of the fingers is frequently a correct indication of the
character of the individual, and taken in connection with the lines of
the palm they serve as a forecast of the person’s life in the past and future.</p>

<p>A hand with pointed fingers (<a href="#hand_figs">see Fig. 1</a>) is
rare and is usually the accompaniment of a delicate, sensitive palm and
is the hand that is most often found among dreamers, poets, idealists,
artists and philosophers. It is an indication that soul rules over
matter and indicates a high-grade personality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Conical fingers (<a href="#hand_figs">as in Fig. 2</a>), with a well-formed thumb,
indicate that the person is quick in action and is ruled by impulse rather than
by calculation. They are the sign of a clever, nervous, energetic character.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="hand_figs" id="hand_figs"></a>
    <img src="images/hand_shape.jpg" alt="HAND SHAPE" width="600" height="417" />
</div>

<p>Square fingers (<a href="#hand_figs">such as are shown in Fig. 3</a>) indicate
perseverance, regularity and a love of order. They are generally found with a thorough
business man, a progressive, law-abiding citizen with a talent for conception
and execution. Their owner is usually methodical, punctual and neat.</p>

<p>Spatulate fingers (<a href="#hand_figs">as shown in Fig. 4</a>) derive their
name from the fact that the “spatula” is a knife-shaped instrument used by druggists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
where the tip is slightly wider than the stem. Fingers of this kind
show action, energy, self-confidence. They are often found in men who
labor with their hands, and seldom with the idle rich.</p>

<p>Knotted fingers (<a href="#hand_figs">as in Fig. 5</a>) are an indication of toil,
energy and resourcefulness. The person is usually more imitative than original,
but is able to turn any situation to some practical advantage.</p>

<p>The refined woman’s hand (<a href="#hand_figs">see Fig. 6</a>) has
the fingers neither spatulate nor square, but usually of the tapering
type, tho not often pronounced, except in the idle women. Possessors of
such hands love beautiful things, crave excitement, act on impulse, but
make good wives and loving mothers.</p>

<p>The criminal’s fingers (<a href="#hand_figs">see Fig. 7</a>) are
usually short and ill-formed. The fingers are wide at the base and
rounded at the nails, which are apt to be thick and coarse. The palm is
soft from lack of manual work. The thumb is short but flexible.</p>

<p>In the workman’s hand (<a href="#hand_figs">see Fig. 8</a>) the
palm is hard and thick; not necessarily from toil but by nature. The
thumb is short and slightly turned back. The fingers are usually coarse
and thick. This hand indicates improvidence, lack of forethought,
and primitive passions. It is also the hand of the savage and the illiterate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Mountains</h3>

<p class="no-indent">are joints or elevations on the palm.</p>

<p><i>Mount Venus</i>, if prominent, indicates a person of strong passions,
great energy in business, and admiration of physical beauty in the
opposite sex; it also indicates love of children, home and wife or
husband. When not well developed, there is a lack of love for home,
children, wife or husband; and in a man it indicates egotism and
laziness; in a woman, hysteria.</p>

<p><i>Mount Jupiter</i>, if prominent, indicates a person who is generous,
loves power and is brilliant in conversation; if a woman, she desires
to shine and be a social leader. When not well developed, it indicates
lack of self-esteem, slovenliness and indifference to personal appearance.</p>

<p><i>Mount Saturn</i>, if prominent, indicates a serious-minded person,
religiously inclined, slow to reach a conclusion, very prudent, free in
the expression of opinions, but inclined to be pessimistic.</p>

<p><i>Mount Apollo</i>, if prominent, indicates ability as an artist,
generosity, courageness and a poetical nature; apt to be a spendthrift.
When not well developed, it indicates cautiousness and prudence.</p>

<p><i>Mount Mercury</i>, if prominent, indicates keen perceptions, cleverness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in conversation, a talent for the sciences, industry and deceitfulness.
If not well developed, it indicates a phlegmatic, stupid disposition.</p>

<p><i>Mount Luna</i>, if prominent, indicates a dreamy, changeable, capricious,
enthusiastic and inventive nature. When not well developed, it
indicates constancy, love of home and ability to imitate others.</p>

<p><i>Mount Mars</i>, if prominent, indicates self-respect, coolness
and control of self under trying circumstances, courageousness,
venturesomeness and confidence in one’s ability for anything undertaken.
When not well developed, it indicates the opposite of these characteristics.</p>

<h3>A Reading of the Lines and Other Characteristics</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Fate Line</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">commences at Rascettes and if it extends straight to Mount
Saturn, uninterrupted, and alike in both hands, good luck and success are
realized without personal exertion. If not in one hand and interrupted
in the other, success will be experienced only by great effort. If
well defined at the wrist, the early life is bright and promising; if
broken in the center, misery, for middle life is indicated. If this
line touches Mounts Luna and Venus it indicates a good disposition and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
wealth; if inclined toward any mount, it implies success in that line
for which the mount stands. If it is made up of disconnected links, it
indicates serious physical and moral struggles. Should it end at the
Heart Line, the life has been ruined by unrequited love. If it runs
through a square, the life has been in danger and saved. Should it
merge into the Heart Line and continue to Mount Jupiter, it denotes
distinction and power secured through love.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Girdle of Venus</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">is a curved line extending from Mount Jupiter to Mercury,
encircling Saturn and Apollo. It appears on few hands, but it indicates superior
intellect, a sensitive and capricious nature; if it extends to the base
of Jupiter it denotes divorce; ending in Mercury, implies great energy;
should it be cut by parallel lines in a man, it indicates a hard
drinker and gambler.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Lines of Reputation</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">commence in the middle of the hand, at the Head Line. Mount
Luna or Mount Mars indicate financial success from intellectual pursuits after
years of struggling with adversity. If from the Heart Line, real
love of occupation and success; if from the Head Line, success from

selfishness. An island on this line denotes loss of character, a star
on it near Apollo implies that success will be permanent, and a square,
brilliant success. The absence of this line implies a struggle for
recognition of one’s abilities.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Line of Intuition</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">beginning at the base of Mount Mercury extends around Mars
and Luna; it is frequently found in the Venus, Mercury and Lunar types of
hands; when deeply dented with a triangle on Mount Saturn, it denotes
clairvoyant power; if it forms a triangle with the Fate Line, or the
Life Line, a voyage will be taken.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Health Line</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">commences at center of the Rascettes, takes an oblique course
from the Fate Line, ending toward Mount Mercury. If straight and well defined,
there is little liability to constitutional diseases; when it does not
extend to the Head Line, steady mental labor cannot be performed; when
it is broad and deep on Mount Mercury, diminishing as it enters the
Life Line, death from heart disease is indicated; small lines cutting
it denote sickness from biliousness. When joined to the Heart Line,
health and business are neglected for love; if made up of short lines,
there is suffering from stomach trouble or catarrh; if it is checked by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
islands there is a constitutional tendency to lung disease.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Marriage Lines</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">extend straight across Mount Mercury; if short, affairs of
the heart without marriage are denoted. When near the Heart Line, early marriage
is indicated; if it turns directly to the Heart Line, marriage will
occur between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one; if close to the top
of the mount, marriage will not take place before the thirty-fifth
year; if it curves upward it indicates a single life; when pronged and
running toward the center or to Mount Mars, divorce will occur. If the
end of this line droops, the subject will outlive wife or husband; if
broken, divorce is implied; if it ends in a cross, the wife or husband
will die from an accident. A branch from this line upward implies a
high position attained by marriage. A black spot on this line means widowhood.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Children’s Lines</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">are small and upright, extending from the end of the Marriage
Line. If broad and well defined, males, if fine and narrow, females are indicated.
A line of this order that is deep and well defined denotes prominence for that child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Small Lines</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">have a signification depending upon their position and number.
A single line on Jupiter signifies success; on Saturn, happiness; on Apollo,
fame and talent.</p>

<p>Ascending small lines are favorable, while descending lines are
unfavorable signs.</p>

<p>Several small lines on Mars indicate warfare constantly.</p>

<p>Cross lines, failure.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lines on the Hand</span></h4>

<p>If not well defined, indicate poor health.</p>

<p>Deep red lines indicate good, robust health.</p>

<p>Yellow lines indicate excessive biliousness.</p>

<p>Dark-colored lines indicate a melancholy and reserved disposition. The
Life Line extends from the outer base of Mount Jupiter, entirely around
the base of Mount Venus. If chained under Jupiter, it indicates bad
health in early life. Hair-lines extending from it imply a weakness,
and if cut by small lines from Mount Venus, misplaced affections and
domestic broils. If arising from Mount Jupiter, an ambition to be
wealthy and learned. If it is joined by the Line of the Head at its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
beginning, prudence and wisdom are indicated. If it joins Heart and
Head lines at its commencement, a great catastrophe will be experienced
by the person so marked. A square on it denotes success. All lines that
follow it give it strength. Lines that cut the Life Line extending
through the Heart Line denote interference in a love affair. If it is
crossed by small lines, illness is indicated. Short and badly drawn
lines, unequal in size, imply bad blood and a tendency to fevers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Heart Line</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">if it extends across the hand at the base of the finger mounts,
and is deep and well defined, indicates purity and devotion; if well
defined from Mount Jupiter only, a jealous and tyrannical disposition
is indicated; if it begins at Mount Saturn and is without branches,
it is a fatal sign; if short and well defined in the Harmonic type of
hand it indicates intense affection when it is reciprocated; if short
on the Mercury type of hand, it implies deep interest in intellectual
pursuits; if short and deep in the Elementary type of hand, it implies
the disposition to satisfy desire by brutal force, instead of by love.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Head Line</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">is parallel to the Heart Line and forms the second branch
of letter M, generally very plain in most hands; if long and deep it indicates
ability to care for one’s self; if hair-lines are attached to it,
mental worry; if it divides toward Mount Mercury, love affairs will be
first, and business secondary; if well defined its whole length, it
implies a well-balanced brain; a line from it extending into a star
on Mount Jupiter, great versatility, pride and love for knowledge are
indicated; if it extend to Mount Luna, interest in occult studies is
implied; separated from the Life Line, indicates agressiveness; if it
is broken, death is indicated from an injury to the head.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Rascettes</span></h4>

<p class="no-indent">are lines across the wrist where the palm joins it.</p>

<p>It is claimed they indicate length of life; if straight it is a good
sign. One Rascette indicates thirty years of life; two lines, sixty;
three lines, ninety.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SCIENCE OF PHRENOLOGY</h2>
</div>

<p>In 1796 a German physician by the name of Franz Gall first announced
what he considered a wonderful discovery and named Phrenology. It was
first introduced into the United States by Dr. Charles Caldwell of
Kentucky, who studied under Gall and who lectured and wrote on the
subject. It made very little headway, however, until Dr. Spurzheim
began to lecture on the new science in Boston, since which time the
number of its adherents has been growing steadily, although there are
many scientific minds who still doubt its teachings.</p>

<p>It is a system of the philosophy of the human mind founded on the
structure of the brain, and embraces a theory of psychology and
organology. It pretends to be able to tell the characteristics of a
person thru signs and bumps. It assumes a corresponding value between the
convolutions of the brain and the character or temperament of the individual.</p>

<p>The idea was not original with Dr. Gall. In the thirteenth century
Albertus Magnus divided the cranium into three regions controlling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Faculties, Judgment and Imagination. In 1562 Luigi Dolce divided
the brain into nine regions controlling as many mental powers. Gall
first noticed that all his fellow schoolboys who were noted for
their knowledge of languages and memory of words had prominent eyes.
Following this as a clew, he arrived at the functions and locations of
twenty-seven organs of mental faculties which he named according to
their action. Spurzheim found still others, and Drs. Fowler and Wells,
the best known American phrenologists, increased the number of such
divisions to thirty-five. They divided them into four principal groups:</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>1. Domestic group; including love, patriotism, fondness for home,
attachment to friends, etc.</p>

<p>2. Selfish group; including combativeness, destructiveness, appetite,
fondness of inflicting pain, etc.</p>

<p>3. Moral group; including sense of right, integrity, justice,
veneration, benevolence, etc.</p>

<p>4. Self-perfecting group; including constructiveness, sense of the
beautiful, imitation, wit, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides these there are two minor groups of Intellectual Faculties:—</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>A. Perceptive Group; including individuality, perception of color,
weight, arrangement, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>B. Reflective Group; including dependence, efficiency, power of
analysis, sympathy, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Many physicians have tried to prove the accuracy of this theory.
Thousands of skulls of human beings as well as of animals have been
examined and their cranial bumps studied. It is believed that each
convolution of the brain is a separate organ and that the great centers
of motion are in the front part of the brain. Many books have been
written on the subject.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/phrenology.jpg" alt="PHRENOLOGY" width="600" height="361" />
</div>

<p>To tell the character of a person by Phrenology requires the services
of a trained expert, and the few indications we can give here can only
serve to call the reader’s attention to the subject in a general way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The foregoing chart is generally used by phrenologists. The numbers
specify the location of each organ, and the following is a description
of the same.</p>

<p class="space-below1">These organs are on the head in the shape of protuberances
or bumps, and can be felt with the fingers. In many cases there is nothing to
indicate their existence, in other cases they are well developed.</p>

<p>The judgment of the phrenologist is determined by the size of the brain
in general and by the size of the organs that have been formulated,
and these are estimated by certain arbitrary rules that render the
boundaries of the regions indefinite.</p>

<p>A study of the cuts and comparison of the sizes of different heads and
their shape will prove very entertaining with most any group of persons
intellectually inclined, and it will be found that persons that are
naturally good readers by instinct of human nature, with its help, can
make remarkable readings in the delineation of character.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SCIENCE OF PHYSIOGNOMY</h2>
</div>

<p>Physiognomy is the science of reading character thru the features and
the facial characteristics. Many persons have a peculiar effect upon
us. We feel antipathetic toward them in spite of their friendliness.
Others awaken our sympathy at once. This has been ascribed to an “Aura”
or electric emanation that affects our own psychic being. It is easy
for the practiced eye to read a person’s peculiar traits by a close
examination of his face. This can be corroborated by a study of his
habits and the way he dresses. While no definite rules can be laid down
for all, the following indications will be found fairly correct and may
be taken as a guide.</p>

<h3>What Different Eyes Indicate</h3>

<p>The long, almond-shaped eye with thick eyelids covering nearly
half of the pupil, when taken in connection with the full brow, is
indicative of genius, and is often found in artists, literary and
scientific men. It is the eye of talent, or impressibility. The large,
open, transparent eye, of whatever color, is indicative of elegance, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
taste, of refinement, of wit, of intelligence. Weakly marked eyebrows
indicate a feeble constitution and a tendency to melancholia.
Deep-sunken eyes are selfish, while eyes in which the whole iris shows
indicate erraticism, if not lunacy. Round eyes are indicative of
innocence, strongly protuberant eyes of weakness of both mind and body.
Eyes small and close together typify cunning, while those far apart
and open indicate frankness. The normal distance between the eyes is
the width of one eye; a distance greater or less than this intensifies
the character supposed to be symbolized. Sharp angles, turning down
at the corners of the eyes, are seen in persons of acute judgment and
penetration. Well-opened, steady eyes belong to the sincere; wide,
staring eyes to the impertinent. Gray eyes are supposed to be the
strongest, blue the weakest, while large eyes are most subject to the
defect known as near-sightedness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FORTUNE-TELLING BY GROUNDS IN A TEACUP</h2>
</div>

<p>Pour your tea into a white cup and drain off the liquid, leaving the
grounds in the cup. Shake them well so as to spread them over as much
of the surface as possible. They will form groups of imaginary figures,
and the fortune-teller must exercise ingenuity to discover in these
figures resemblances to familiar things. To the inexpert eye there may
be nothing but detached particles of tea, but to the chiromancer it
will be easy to find familiar forms.</p>

<p>Long wavy lines are interpreted as meaning loss and trouble.</p>

<p>The more lines there are, the greater their influence.</p>

<p>Straight lines indicate long life and peace.</p>

<p>Circles indicate that money will soon be received, but if they are
connected by straight lines, there will be a delay.</p>

<p>Squares and oblongs denote peace and happiness, while angular and
distorted figures foretell annoyance and worry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>A large number of lines running parallel signify a happy old age.</p>

<p>A crown brings honor and success.</p>

<p>A cross is a bad sign and usually means the death of a dear one.</p>

<p>But if there are two or more crosses, it means an unexpected honor.</p>

<p>A ring denotes marriage, while if there is a letter of the alphabet
inside of it or near by, it foretells the initial of a lucky spouse. If
there are lines above or below the ring, it means a disappointment.</p>

<p>A clover leaf is a good sign and usually denotes good luck.</p>

<p>Figures of flowers denote long life and happiness. If at the extreme
bottom of the cup, they mean a disappointment.</p>

<p>Figure of a tree near the top foretells disappointment. Several trees
are a sure sign of misfortune. A tree near a circle denotes a visit to the
country. An X is a good sign and means that your wishes will soon come true.</p>

<p>A mountain denotes a trip to be taken shortly.</p>

<p>A star denotes happiness, while the crescent of a moon means success.</p>

<p>Birds are a sign of good luck.</p>

<p>The figure of a fish denotes good news from a distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>A snake is a sign of an enemy and tells you to beware.</p>

<p>A heart signifies joy and the receipt of money.</p>

<p>Any letter by itself denotes good news from a person whose initial
letter that happens to be.</p>

<p>A long line signifies a journey.</p>

<p>A circle with a cross inside usually foretells the birth of a child and
is a lucky sign.</p>

<p>An anchor means success in business. If near the top of the cup, it
speaks of fidelity and love.</p>

<p>A crown and a cross near each other denote that you will inherit a
large fortune.</p>

<p>People of poetical views will be able to find many more articles from
which they can draw their own interpretation.</p>

<p>Telling fortunes by means of coffee grounds in a cup follows the same
general rule, altho the figures are much less varied.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DREAMS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION</h2>
</div>

<p>Dreams are the thoughts or impressions that occupy our minds when we
are asleep.</p>

<p>Every night, unless disease or strong excitement prevent, we are the
subject of a phenomenon which if it only occurred once in a lifetime we
would consider one of the greatest mysteries. We pass in an unconscious
moment from the usual world of deed and action into another world,
where we are unaware of what goes on around us; where we see, not with
the eyes, where we hear things of which the ear gives no impression; in
which we speak and are spoken to, altho no speech passes our lips or
reaches our organs of hearing.</p>

<p>In that world we are excited to joy, to grief; we are moved to pity, we
are stirred to anger; and yet these emotions are aroused by things that
do not exist. Time seems to have lost its landmarks; distance offers no barriers;
the dead return and the past comes once again to cheer or to grieve us.</p>

<p>We live in a land of Dreams. Many of the thoughts that pass thru our
brains are forgotten before we awake. It often happens that people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
talk in their sleep, thus proving that they are dreaming, but on being
awakened they deny that they dreamed, for their dreams have left no
trace upon their memory.</p>

<p>The question whether we ever sleep without dreaming is as old as
the days of the ancient Greek philosophers, and there are many able
authorities on both sides of the question.</p>

<p>Locke, a great writer on mental phenomena, is of the opinion that
dreaming is not always present during sleep; but many of the ancient
as well as the modern writers contend that the mind is never at rest
but continues uninterruptedly even in sleep, and that to cease to dream
would be to cease to live.</p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton argues as follows: “When we dream, we are
assuredly asleep, but the mind is not asleep, because it thinks. It is
therefore manifest that mental processes may go on even tho the body
is unconscious. To have no recollection of our dreams does not prove that
we have not dreamed, altho the dream may have left no trace on our memories.”</p>

<p>Dreams, like our waking thoughts, are dependent on the laws of
association. Altho the senses, are usually torpid in sleep, some of
them continue to transmit to the mind imperfect sensations which they

receive. Experiments have been tried to determine how far external
impressions will cause dreams. A bottle of hot water applied to the
feet of a sleeping man caused him to dream that he was on the crater
of a volcano and that the hot earth was scorching his feet. Another
man, having a blister applied to his head, dreamed that he was being
scalped by Indians. A match suddenly lit may cause a man to dream of a
terrible storm with lightning and thunder. Darwin relates the case of a
man who was born deaf and dumb, and who never dreamed that he conversed
with others except thru the sign language. So, also, a blind man never
dreams of seeing vivid colors. Thus we see that our dreams are in many
cases dependent upon our senses.</p>

<p>The condition of our digestion may also influence our dreams. If the
digestive functions are properly performed, our dreams are apt to be
pleasant, whereas every one knows the torturing dreams that may follow
an indigestible supper of Welsh rabbit or lobster. In the same way
the dreams that are caused by opium or other drugs or by intoxicating
liquors are apt to be of a disagreeable nature.</p>

<p>The mind works with wonderful rapidity during sleep. A person who is
suddenly awakened by a loud noise may dream of many things in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
short second before he awakens. A long story may spin itself out in
his brain,—adventure, robbery, war,—until he is awakened by what he
believes is a shot. A certain writer was suddenly aroused from a sound
sleep by a few drops of water sprinkled on his face. He dreamed of the
events of an entire life in which sorrow and happiness were mingled, of
a fight on the banks of a stream into which an enemy plunged him. We
can dream more in a minute of time than we can enact in a day.</p>

<p>So, too, dreams are often characteristic of the peculiar life and
thoughts of the dreamer. A miser will dream of saving money, a merchant
of business deals, a musician of melody, etc. As a general thing our
dreams are wanting in coherence. They do not seem true to life. They
mix together things that are absurd and unconnected. We never dream of
the past as a thing that is past, but as a reality. People that are
long dead appear to us as living.</p>

<h3>Do Dreams Foretell the Future?</h3>

<p>It is a popular belief, and has been thru all ages, that dreams
foretell for us what will happen. Many remarkable cases seem to prove
this. All nations of antiquity believed in the divine nature of dreams.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
The Bible is full of allusions to dreams and most of the important
events were revealed to men thru dreams.</p>

<p>Jacob dreamed that he saw a ladder which reached into the sky and that
angels were ascending and descending. His whole life was shaped by this
vision. His son, Joseph, was called “The Dreamer” by his brothers. We
all know the fascinating story of his dreams, his interpretations of
the visions of the butler and the baker and his reading of Pharaoh’s
dream which eventually obtained for him the position of ruler over
Egypt. The Books of the Prophets and of Daniel are based on dreams. So
are many of the incidents of the New Testament.</p>

<p>Coming down to more modern times, we find that many intelligent
men—writers, inventors, kings—believed in dreams.</p>

<p>Franklin believed that he obtained a clearer insight into political
events thru his dreams and often acted upon the inspiration he received
while asleep.</p>

<p>A celebrated doctor discovered a well-known remedy thru a dream.
Tartini, a celebrated musician, is said to have composed his “Devil’s
Sonata” under the inspiration of a dream in which the devil appeared to
him and invited him to try his skill upon his favorite fiddle. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
awoke, the music was so firmly impressed upon his memory that he had no
difficulty in writing it out on paper.</p>

<p>The poet Coleridge is said to have composed his poem “Kubla Khan” in a
dream. He had taken an anodyne for some slight indisposition, and fell
asleep in his chair. When he awoke he retained the impression of over
two hundred lines of verse which had come to him in his slumber.</p>

<p>Cabanis, the philosopher, found in his sleep the conclusions of many
problems that he was not able to solve while awake. Condorcet, the
mathematician, found in his sleep the final steps in a calculation that
baffled him while awake.</p>

<p>Napoleon was a great believer in dreams and was often guided by them in
his campaigns.</p>

<p>Columbus, it is said, dreamed that a voice spoke to him saying, “God
will give thee the keys of the gates of the Ocean,” and that it was
this that kept up his courage.</p>

<p>In remote times the greatest of importance was attached to dreams.
The ancients resorted to them in cases of difficulty or calamity.
When pestilence spread among the Greeks before Troy, Homer represents
Achilles as taking refuge in dreams, his reason being,—</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Dreams descend from Jove</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Aristotle, Plato, Zeno, Pythagoras, Socrates, Xenophon and Sophocles have all
expressed their belief in the divine or prophetic character of dreams.</p>

<p>A great number of historical instances are recorded in Greek and Latin
classics of dreams that came true. The night before the assassination
of Julius Cæsar, his wife Calpurnia dreamed that her husband fell
bleeding across her knees. She tried to warn him, but he laughed at
her fears. On the night that Attila died, the Emperor Marcian at
Constantinople dreamed that he saw the bow of the conqueror broken asunder.
Cicero relates a dream thru which a murderer was brought to justice.</p>

<p>Dreams were even allowed to influence legislation. During the Marsic
War (90 B.C.) the Roman senate ordered the temple of Juno to be
rebuilt, in consequence of a dream. There are many other examples in
ancient history.</p>

<p>The old fathers of the Christian Church attached considerable
importance to dreams. Tertullian thought they came from God as one of a
series of prophecy, though he attributed many dreams to the influence
of evil spirits. St. Augustine relates a dream thru which he was
convinced of the immortality of the soul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<h3>How Dreams Should be Interpreted</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of dreams: those that are reproductions of one’s
waking thoughts or actions, or the result of digestive disturbances;
and those that proceed from some psychological condition which we
cannot probe or understand. Many dreams are of so trivial a nature
that it would be foolish to attribute any importance to them. Others
seems to come from some outside inspiration and are prophetic. The
ancient sages who were celebrated as interpreters of dreams had a maxim
that the “Result of dreams often follows their interpretation.” They
meant that if you believe that a dream means a certain thing, you will
fashion your actions so that that thing will come true.</p>

<p>When the meaning of a dream is indefinite, many interpretations can be
put on it and all of them be capable of coming true. If you are told
that a dream means illness, you may take it so to heart that you will
actually fall ill, or if you are philosophical, you will shape your
diet or your deeds so that good health may result from the warning. If
a man dreams that he will have financial disaster, he may become so
unfitted thru fear that he will neglect his business and thus invite
the ruin which he imagines the dream foretold. Or he may, if he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
wise, take the opposite course and so shape his business methods that
success will follow instead of ruin.</p>

<p>In the following tables we give the interpretations of common dreams as
they are and have been given from time immemorial in most of the best
known sources, with quite a number of original meanings as experience
has shown them to us. Remember that the interpretation of dreams may
vary with the peculiar conditions and circumstances surrounding the
dreamer, and what would be true in the case of a sickly person might
have the opposite meaning in the case of a robust man. “Man is master
of his fate,” says a poet. The troubles that cause one person to take a
pessimistic attitude and contemplate suicide serve to spur another on
to new endeavors and new successes.</p>

<p>This book is not intended to foster superstition, but to offer a means
of solving many of the mysterious occurrences in our lives and help you
rise above your surroundings to a higher plane of usefulness.</p>

<h3>A Dictionary of Dreams</h3>

<p>As a rule dreams are very complex and it is difficult to single out any
particular feature that stands forth and dominates the dream. But it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
frequently happens that one idea is so vivid that it is remembered
to the exclusion of all the rest. When you have a dream of this kind
refer at once to the following list, look up the dominant thought of
your dream and the interpretation will be given. These meanings are not
random guesses, but are compiled from a number of very old books which
have come down to us from such seers, astrologers and psychologists
as Cagliostro, Lenormand, Albertus Magnus and others. Of course the
meaning of the dream may be considerably modified by what subconscious
thoughts accompany the dream. Thus while pearls may represent tears,
yet if they are accompanied by the idea of love the indication is
favorable, and means a gift of affection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS</h2>

<span class="i0"><i>Oh, flowers, you darlings of Nature,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How lovely and sweet are you;</i></span>

<p>There is a sentiment about flowers which appeals to the heart of
everyone. The lover conveys his message of love, the friend, his token
of friendship thru a bouquet or box of blooming flowers. Every incident
of our busy and eventful lives can be celebrated by the gift of
flowers. Births, christenings, birthdays, graduations, confirmations,
weddings, anniversaries and funerals:—all are appropriately observed by
the sending of plants or blossoms. It is not strange, therefore, that
among most nations a sentimental language has been created in which
the flower speaks its part and repeats the message of the heart. While
there is no fixed vocabulary, the following table gives the sentiments
most frequently associated with flowers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>By combining flowers, various shades of sentiment can be expressed and
whole messages conveyed.</p>

<p>For instance—</p>

<p>A camellia, rose and carnation would mean, “Your loveliness attracts
me. Smile upon me, and cheer my poor heart.”</p>

<p>Moss rose and myrtle mean, “Your superior merit makes me love you.”</p>

<p>Lily-of-the-Valley and ferns mean, “You fascinate me and my happiness returns.”</p>

<p>Yellow rose and ivy mean, “My love increases, can I hope for matrimony?”</p>

<p>A rosebud divested of its thorns, but retaining its leaves, conveys the
sentiment, “I fear no longer; I hope.” Stripped of leaves and thorns,
it signifies, “There is nothing to hope or fear.”</p>

<p class="space-below1">A full-blown rose placed over two buds
signifies “Secrecy.” “Yes,” is implied by touching the flower given to
the lips. “No,” by pinching off a petal and casting it away. “I am,” is
expressed by a laurel leaf, twined around the bouquet. “I have,” by an
ivy leaf folded together. “I offer you,” by a leaf of Virginia creeper.

<h2 class="nobreak">POPULAR BELIEFS AMONG THE ANCIENTS<br /> AS TO THE INFLUENCE OF<br /> PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
</div>

<p>It would require a volume to give a summary of all the quaint and
mysterious beliefs that cluster about precious stones. From very
ancient times they have been more or less associated with the idea
that they influence human life and happiness. Below we give a few of
the many traits and influences of the stones in general use. We do
not desire to appeal to the credulity of our readers, but merely to
enlighten them as to the folklore of this subject.</p>

<p>These indications are taken literally from “many a quaint and curious
volume of forgotten lore.”</p>

<p><i>Agate.</i>—An old popular notion regards it as a guarantee against
drunkenness. The water in which it is steeped is said to cure
sterility. It is said also to counteract magical charms.</p>

<p><i>Batrachite.</i>—This substance, which is really silicate of magnesia,
used to be regarded as a stone found in the body of a frog, and it was
supposed to have great powers against poison and sorcery.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beryl.</i>—The water in which this stone has been dipped causes sympathy
between those who drink it.</p>

<p><i>Chrysolite.</i>—Albertus Magnus regarded it as a preservative against
frenzy, but it is also a penitential stone, causing sorrow for
wrongdoing in the heart of the sinner who wears it. Finally it is a
cure for the gout.</p>

<p><i>Chrysoprase.</i>—Has the property of strengthening the eyes, raising the
spirits and rendering a man liberal and joyous.</p>

<p><i>Coral.</i>—Was said to protect any house against epidemic disease, to
stop the flow of blood, to drive away evil spirits, to avert lightning and hail.</p>

<p><i>Diamond.</i>—It would be curious if many traditions of occult power had
not centralized about this precious stone, and a bare enumeration only
of its virtues is possible in the present place. It prevails against
poison, plague, panic, insomnia, charms and enchantments. It soothes
anger, reconciles husbands and wives. When it has been consecrated
under the planet Mars and engraved with an image of that deity, it
renders the wearer invincible, whence it naturally inspires courage.
Worn round the neck, it insures safe childbirth. In some other ways, it
seems to have been regarded as unpropitious.</p>

<p><i>Emerald.</i>—If ground into powder, this stone was supposed to cure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
dysentery and the bites of venomous animals. There is a chance that
those who wear it will not be subject to epilepsy. It also strengthens
memory and maintains chastity.</p>

<p><i>Heliotrope.</i>—The stone bearing the name, in common with a beautiful
and well-known flower, should be sought by the curious, as it renders
the wearer invisible. But it is unknown in these days.</p>

<p><i>Hematite or Bloodstone.</i>—Valuable for its power in incantations,
against the sorcery of the evil eye, and to cement the bonds of
friendship among male persons.</p>

<p><i>Hyacinth.</i>—This also is a preservative against the plague, which was
a common scourge in the old days, and was therefore an especial concern of occult
medicine and its substitutes. The hyacinth was also a cure for dropsy.</p>

<p><i>Jade.</i>—This is another stone which protects against venomous beasts.</p>

<p><i>Jasper.</i>—This stone is noticeable chiefly as a favorite gem on which
magical signs were engraved, so that they might be worn as amulets. But
it also preserved the wearer from poisonous bites.</p>

<p><i>Linurgas or Lapis Lineus.</i>—A stone of ancient repute which would turn
white if enveloped in a linen cloth, and the use of it would then prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
beneficial in projects of magic. But it has been decided that the gem
itself is fabulous, not to speak of the properties attributed thereto.</p>

<p><i>Onyx.</i>—When engraved with the head of a camel, this stone procured
evil dreams. It may have been used against enemies.</p>

<p><i>Opal.</i>—The malefic influence which is sometimes attributed to this
jewel, by which it has almost come to be regarded as unfortunate in the
world of gems, has little authority in past traditions. It acted rather
like a cordial to the heart of the wearer, was a safeguard against
poison and contagion transmitted in the atmosphere; it served to raise
the spirits and was valuable in affections of the eye.</p>

<p><i>Pearl.</i>—If worn on the neck, it preserved chastity; if ground to
powder and taken in milk, it sweetened irritable tempers; if ground
with sugar, it cured pestilential fevers.</p>

<p><i>Perithe.</i>—Whether precious or not, this stone seems unfamiliar to
lapidaries, and as regards its appearance we can only report that it
was of yellow color. Its virtue was to cure gout, and it had the power
to burn the hand when it was held firmly. There are other fabulous
stones, as, for example, Lapis Aguila or Eagle Stone, said to be found
in the nest of that bird. It assisted childbirth, and according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Dioscorides, served to discover thieves.</p>

<p><i>Ruby.</i>—The range of auspicious influences possessed by precious
stones is exceedingly restricted, and the same virtues recur
continually. The ruby resists poison, preserves from the plague,
banishes melancholy and diverts evil thoughts. If it should change its
color, this is a sign of approaching misfortunes, but it reverts to the
original hue when the evil has passed away.</p>

<p><i>Sapphire.</i>—This stone was good for inflammation of the eyes, and it
also attracted good fortune.</p>

<p><i>Topaz.</i>—This has the faculty of cooling boiling water, and it has
been said that those who desire to regain lost positions should not
fail to carry it about their person. It procures the sympathy of the
whole world.</p>

<p><i>Turquoise.</i>—We find only that this gem is liable to change its color
when worn by certain people, not otherwise described.</p>

<h3>The Language of Precious Stones</h3>

<p>The ancients attributed marvelous properties to many of the precious
stones. We give in tabular form the different months and the stones
sacred to them, with their respective meanings. It has been customary
among lovers and friends to notice the significance attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
various stones in making birthday, engagement and wedding presents.</p>

<li class="isub2"><i>April, Sapphire</i>—Free from enchantment; denotes repentance.</li>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LANGUAGE OF POSTAGE STAMPS</h2>
</div>

<p>The government desires the postage stamp to be placed on a letter in
the extreme upper right-hand corner. This is requested in order to facilitate
the canceling of a stamp by a special machine made for that purpose.</p>

<p>Lovers, however, often oppose this regulation and use the stamp as a
means of conveying a message to their beloved. The following are the
usual meanings attached to the position of the stamp:</p>

<p>Placing the stamp in the upper right-hand corner at a slight angle
means: “I expect an immediate reply.”</p>

<p>At an angle of 45 degrees: “I am provoked at your long silence.”</p>

<p>Placing the stamp upside down: “You are very cruel.”</p>

<p>Placing the stamp half an inch from the upper and right-hand edges
means: “Expect me tonight.” Placing the stamp at the upper left-hand
corner: “Be careful how you reply to this.”</p>

<p>Placing the stamp at the lower right-hand corner: “Beware! Father has caught on.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Tearing a stamp in half and placing each half with a slight space
between; in the upper right-hand corner: “Our friendship is at an end.”</p>

<p>Tearing the stamp and placing the halves in the upper left-hand corner:
“You have broken my heart.”</p>

<p>Using two one-cent stamps; in place of a two-cent stamp, if placed
alongside of each other in the upper right-hand corner, means: “My love
for you has doubled.”</p>

<p>Two penny stamps in the upper left-hand corner means: “You have a rival.”</p>

<p>Two penny stamps one above the other means: “I will call to see you tonight.”</p>

<p>Two two-cent stamps where only one is necessary means: “My love for you
stops at nothing.”</p>

<p>Two penny stamps reversed means: “I am thinking of you with joy.”</p>

<p>Lovers frequently place a message of love under the stamp, which must
be taken off in order that the message can be read.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MEANING OF MOLES</h2>
</div>

<p>Moles, which appear on the bodies of most persons in various locations,
have always been mysteriously connected with the fate of the individual
concerned. Just how this belief originated it is hard to tell, but the
fundamental idea is that moles are placed upon the body to foretell an
event or decide the characteristics of a person.</p>

<p>In some countries moles are regarded with reverence, and the hair which
grows in tufts from the moles is never pulled out or shaved. In Latin
countries it is a common sight to see men with clean-shaven faces but with
a mole on cheek or chin from which the hair is allowed to grow quite long.</p>

<p>Authorities differ as to the significance of moles and give different
interpretations to them. The following may be taken as the most accepted view:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">A mole on the right cheek indicates beauty, modesty, charity.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the left cheek indicates vanity and frivolity.
                 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the chin denotes long life to the bearer.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole over either eye indicates sagacity and farsightedness.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the forehead signifies mental activity and ambition.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the neck near the front indicates artistic temperament.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the right shoulder indicates beauty and capriciousness.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the left shoulder indicates domestic accomplishments and tastes.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the right bosom indicates tendency to weakness and ill health.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the left bosom indicates a tendency to hereditary illness.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the back indicates characteristics inherited from the father.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the abdomen indicates robust health and vigor.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the right thigh indicates virile strength.</li>
<li class="isub2">A mole on the left thigh indicates ambition and success.</li>
<li class="isub2">Many small moles on arms or legs indicate robust health and long life.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="nobreak">WEATHER PROPHECIES FROM AN OLD ALMANAC</h2>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Chances of the Coming Year.</i>—If the night of January 1 should
be fine and calm, without rain or wind, it signifies a good year and
abundance of everything. If the wind is in the east, there will be
mortality of cattle; if in the west, there will be grave trouble, wars
and dissensions among nations; if in the south, there will be some
mortality among human beings; if in the north, there is the likelihood
of barrenness in all harvests.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Year’s Chances.</i>—When Christmas Day falls during the moon’s
increase, the year will be very good, and the nearer that it is to the
new moon the better it will be. But if it falls during the waning moon,
there will be a hard year, and the nearer that it is to the decrescence
the worse it will be.</p>

<p>3. <i>Signs of the Sun.</i>—If it be red in the morning, there will be
rain in the evening; if it be red in the evening, a fine morning will
follow. Fine weather must not be expected when the sun rises with long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
beams of light shooting over devolving clouds. Should the luminary
look small and round like a ball this denotes rain or tempest. Rain
and thunder are signified when the sun grows dark and obscure in the
daytime. A bad day will follow when it sets enveloped in black cloud.</p>

<p>4. <i>Signs of Fine Weather.</i>—This is denoted by a slight fog in the
east before sunrise; by a white or aureated border about the horizon,
and moisture on windows at dawn; by a heavy dew and a serene sun in the
early morning; and by clearness, brightness and small, scattered red
clouds at sunset.</p>

<p>5. <i>Lunar Signs.</i>—A blue tinge on the moon portends rain, a red tinge
means wind to come, but white coloring signifies fine weather. Fine
days are likely to follow a fine Tuesday. If the horns are obscured
on the third or fourth day, this indicates rain. If the circle of the
moon is red, a bad time may follow; if it does not appear at all on the
fourth day of its renewal, the whole period of the moon will be dull
and rainy. If it rains on the first Tuesday after the full moon, it
will so continue during the rest of the moon’s period, and the reverse
in the contrary case. If the moon is clear on rising, there will be
fine weather in summer and severe cold in winter; clearness at the full promises
a fair time; so also when the halo melts quickly, but a double halo means storm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>Star Signs.</i>—When the stars seem longer than usual, rain is
likely; when they are nebulous or obscure, though no clouds are
visible, this means rain or snow—according to season. When they are
encircled by fog, a cold wind is betokened; when they are clear and
sparkling, it means cold in winter and fair weather in summer.</p>

<p>7. <i>Vintage Prospects.</i>—If the sun is clear and bright on the Feast
of Vincent, an old adage says that there will be more wind than water,
which means that there will be a rich harvest of grapes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW TO TELL ONE’S AGE</h2>
</div>

<p>Girls of a marriageable age do not like to tell how old they are, but
you can find out by following these instructions, the young lady doing
the figuring. Tell her to put down the number of the month in which she
was born; then to multiply it by 2; then to add 5; then to multiply it
by 50; then to add her age; then to subtract 365; then to add 115; then
tell her to tell you the amount she has left. The two figures to the
right will denote her age, and the remainder the month of her birth.
For example, the amount is 822. She is twenty-two years old, and was
born in the eighth month, (August.) Try it.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of amusement in the following magical table of
figures. It will enable you to tell how old the ladies are. Just hand
this table to a young lady, and request her to tell you in which column
or columns her age is contained, and add together the figures at the
top of the columns in which her age is found, and you have the great
secret. Thus suppose her age to be 17, you will find that number in the
first and fifth columns; add the first figures of these two columns.
Here is the magic table:

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW TO BE BEAUTIFUL</h2>
</div>

<p>Moore, the poet, has given expression to his ideal
of beauty in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>This was not the beauty, oh, nothing like this,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That to young Nourmahal gave such magic bliss;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But that loveliness, ever in motion, which plays</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like the light upon autumn’s shadowy days.</i>”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Now here and now there, giving warmth as it flies</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From the lips to the cheek, from the cheek to the eyes;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now melting in mist, and now breaking in gleams,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like the glimpses a saint has of heavenly dreams.</i>”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Wordsworth also expressed himself in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>He was among the prime in worth,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>An object beauteous to behold:</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Well born, well bred; I sent him forth</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ingenuous, innocent, and bold.</i>”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Perhaps you ask how you can attain beauty if you do not possess it?
Or, if you have some of its qualities, how you may get those you are
lacking. If you will practice the following rules you will grow more
and more beautiful in the eyes of others, even if age does bring gray
hair and a wrinkled skin.</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p><i>First</i>—Cleanliness is next to godliness. Practice it in every feature
of your daily life.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>—Have some purpose to achieve and steadfastly work to attain it.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>—Cultivate self-discipline; be master of your passions, under
all circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>—Study to know the laws of life that yield harmony and good
health and obey them. Look on the bright side of life always.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>—Avoid intemperance in all things.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>—Cultivate every mental and bodily quality that will make you
firm in goodness, strong and physically able to be useful to your kind,
generous and broad-minded, self-sacrificing, and you will daily and
hourly be lovely and grow into the beautiful.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
